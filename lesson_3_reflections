Q 1   When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when i want to show my work to other people and share my work with them. 

Q 2 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

		so I can control when i want chaneges to happen on my local repository.
