How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it was fun. and I enjoyed it a lot 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it will help me make some major changes in my code without worry about breaking the code


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    because it depends on the programer to create a commit so you cannot insure
    about programmer is going to create right commite at a right place and automatic saving 
    also have some disavantages like it could save lot but changes in those file are not much.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because git was created to help programers but google docs was created for documents
    which are not realted most of the time but code files could be realted.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git checkout

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    because I can also go back to last working file without worrying anything

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    my android projects
